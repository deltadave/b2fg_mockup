# D&D Beyond to Fantasy Grounds Converter

A web-based utility that converts D&D Beyond character data to Fantasy Grounds XML format, enabling seamless character transfers between the two platforms.

## Overview

This tool fetches character data from D&D Beyond's API and converts it to Fantasy Grounds Unity (FGU) compatible XML format. The project is currently undergoing a complete modernization from legacy JavaScript to a TypeScript-based architecture with modern tooling.

## Features

- **Character Conversion**: Convert D&D Beyond characters to Fantasy Grounds XML format
- **Comprehensive Data Processing**: Handles ability scores, inventory, spells, class features, and racial traits
- **Fantasy Grounds Compatibility**: Generates XML compatible with Fantasy Grounds Unity
- **Client-Side Processing**: All conversion happens in the browser - no server required
- **Encumbrance Calculation**: Supports advanced encumbrance rules including Goliath Powerful Build
- **Spell Slot Management**: Accurate multiclass spell slot calculation including Warlock Pact Magic
- **Class Feature Support**: Extensive support for class-specific features and racial traits

## Quick Start

### Legacy Version (Current Production)
1. Open `legacy/index.html` in a web browser
2. Enter your D&D Beyond character ID or URL
3. Click "Convert Character"
4. Download the generated XML file
5. Import into Fantasy Grounds Unity

### Development Version (In Progress)
```bash
cd devel
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Technology Stack

### Legacy (Current)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 4, custom CSS
- **Architecture**: Monolithic client-side application

### Modern (In Development)
- **Frontend**: Alpine.js 3.x, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build**: Vite, Vitest for testing
- **Architecture**: Domain-driven design with SOLID principles

## API Integration

- **Proxy Service**: `https://uakari-indigo.fly.dev/` (bypasses CORS restrictions)
- **D&D Beyond API**: `https://character-service.dndbeyond.com/character/v5/character/`
- **Character Data**: Fetches comprehensive character JSON including classes, races, equipment, and spells

## Development

### Legacy Development
No build process required - open `legacy/index.html` directly in browser.

### Modern Development
```bash
cd devel
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run test         # Run test suite
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type checking
```

## Testing

### Legacy
Manual testing with sample character data in `data/` directory.

### Modern
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end character conversion testing
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type checking

## Refactoring Progress

The project is following a **Strangler Fig Pattern** migration strategy:

1. **âœ… Phase 1**: Foundation setup with modern tooling
2. **ðŸš§ Phase 2**: Feature-by-feature migration with XML integration
3. **ðŸ“‹ Phase 3**: UI migration to Alpine.js components

See [REFACTOR_PLAN.md](REFACTOR_PLAN.md) for detailed migration strategy and progress.
