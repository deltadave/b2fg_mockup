# 8 step vibe devel process

create a git repo

link a local directory to the repo

## Setup

`invoke the 01-product-manager agent, and pass in the high-level.txt as it's initial starting context`

this will create the product-requirements.md document. Read and validate this file. Is there anything missing or not correct.

`/clear`

`invoke the 02-system-architect agent and pass in the product-requirements.md and tech-stack-pref.md as it's primary context`

preferred tech stack is react native with a minimal library list
the agent must ask before making any changes

the architect will make the architecture-output.md file. This file should be read and understood.

'/clear'
'invoke the 03-ux-designer agent, passing in product-requirements.md as the primary context`

will create the design. will take quite a bit of time and tokens. 
will document the result in design-documentation/

`go through every directory inside of design-documentation/features and see if we added in any new technical details or dependencies that now need to be accounted for by the 02-system-architect agent.`

look at the resulting list of updates and decide if you really want to do all the things on it for your mvp

`clear`
`invoke the typescript-pro agent with tech-stack-pref.md, design-documentation, and project-documentation as context. use the implementation-guide.md as a checklist of items to address, in order. show me the item you intend to address before starting with a list of alternates to choose from. Do not start work until I ok it.`


## Core Development loop

follow a methodical approach - 3 agents in use in a looping process. typescript-pro, security and qa 

`/clear`

`invoke the typescript-pro agent. The inputs for this agent are any of the necessary configuration files found in the main root project directory, as well as the details found in project/project-documentation/system-architecture-analysis.md and project/project-documentation/design-documentation/features/. we are only building the features for the next action item. use the implementation-guide.md as a checklist of items to address, in order. show me the item you intend to address before starting, with a list of alternates to choose from. Do not start work until I ok it.`

invoke the typescript-pro agent with tech-stack-pref.md, design-documentation, and project-documentation as context. use the implementation-guide.md as a checklist of items to address, in order. lets work on the next unfinished
  item. show me the item you intend to address before starting with a list of alternates to choose from. Do not start work until I ok it.
