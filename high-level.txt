Beyond to Fantasy Grounds Converter (b2fg) is a web utility that converts D&D Beyond character json to Fantasy Grounds Unity (fgu) character XML

Users enter a character ID for a D&DB character and if the json can be retrieved, the conversion process will take place.

When the XML is complete, the user can download it for import into FGU

The Use flow should be as follows.
1. The user enters an ID number
  the id number is validated as being appropriate (ie all numbers)
2. json for that character is retrieved and stored
3. character state is constructed from the json
4. xml is constructed from character state
5. xml character is saved to the local computer
